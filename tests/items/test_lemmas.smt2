; Complex satisfiable QF_LIA SMT-LIB file
; Logic: QF_LIA (Quantifier-Free Linear Integer Arithmetic)
; This file uses many linear integer equalities/inequalities, ite expressions,
; and Boolean combinations while remaining in the QF_LIA fragment.
; It is intentionally syntactically varied and satisfiable.
